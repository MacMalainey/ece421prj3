\subsection{Backend Stack}

The backend is implemented using \mintinline{text}|rocket(v0.5.0)| for the backend server framework. 
Through \mintinline{text}|rocket|'s database connection pool library we used \mintinline{text}|diesel|
as the backend database library which interfaces with a \mintinline{text}|sqlite3| database.

The original design was to use \mintinline{text}|rocket(v0.4.4)| with a \mintinline{text}|mongodb| database through \mintinline{text}|rocket|'s database connection pool library.
This would allow us to carry over the prior project's database with minimal issue.
However we found that some of the dependencies had been removed from \mintinline{text}{crates.io} and therefore were not able to use \mintinline{text}|mongodb| with \mintinline{text}|rocket(v0.4.4)|.
Sadly \mintinline{text}|rocket(v0.5.0)| does not support \mintinline{text}|mongodb| and we decided it was best to not homebrew a solution together.  That is what led us to using \mintinline{text}|diesel|
with a \mintinline{text}|sqlite3| database. We felt \mintinline{text}|diesel| was a better option than \mintinline{text}|rusqlite| with its CLI app to be able to create and run database migrations,
embed migrations into the app so that the database could be built on first run as well as the compile time query checking saving a lot of potential headaches during development and for future development and saved on boilerplate code.

\subsection{Admin CLI}

A local database can be investigated and altered directly using \mintinline{text}|prj3_cli|.
To use, run the CLI and when prompted specify a path for the database you wish to alter.
If no database exists at the given path one will be created.  Then use the next menu to perform various actions on the database.

\section{Web Client}

\section{Local Setup}

\subsection{Notice}
The tutorial assumes you have the Rust toolchain installed on your system.
Also, the install SQLite3 step is not necessary since sqlite3 is compiled using the library bundled with the \mintinline{text}|libsqlite3-sys| package,
however this does increase the download size for the dependency but for environment consistency is recommended.
Database initialization can be completed by running the CLI or running the server with the features mentioned in the tutorial.

\subsection{Default Config}

The default database path is \mintinline{text}|$PROJ_ROOT$/localdev.db|

The default port that the local web server serves on is \mintinline{text}|8080|

The default port that the backend API server serves on is \mintinline{text}|8000|

IMPORTANT: a proxy is set up for the API calls (see \href{run: ../Trunk.toml}{Trunk.toml}) for the local web server that expects the backend API server to be running on the same machine on the port mentioned above.
If you wish to change the port or host the backend API server on a different device you will need to update the proxy address in the mentioned config file.

\subsection{Instructions}

See the \href{run:../README.md}{readme} for information on setting up the environment and running the server backend and web client.

\section{Key Design Considerations}

\subsection{Computerized Board}
Using a computerized board provides several key advantages over a physical board. It allows a player to play against a computerized opponent meaning a player can play and have fun by themselves. It also allows the tracking of games and statistics, allowing players to compare themselves to other players. Using a computerized board also removes the need to manually check if a player has won or lost. A computerized board also prevents cheating. \\

In our program, the board state is represented as a vector with length \mintinline{text}{rows * columns}. We then provide methods that abstract access to the board state as if it were a matrix: for example, to access the slot at row 3 and column 5, we can calculate the index in the vector as \mintinline{text}{3 * columns + 5}.

\subsection{Computerized Opponents}
A computerized opponent is essentially code that tries to makes smart decisions in order to win (i.e. beat the other player). This is done by attempting to determine the best move from the set of possible moves. This is done by giving each possible move a score by using an algorithm. 



\subsection{Interface Components}

\subsection{Exception Handling}

In a GUI app exception handling must be taken with care.
In a CLI app or script it might be acceptable to simply print out an error message and move on, or just panic on those rare slightly incovnient to safely handle errors.
However, for a GUI app this is much different because we always want to ensuring the app remains responsive and that the user has enough feedback from our app to determine what the next rational step should be.
Since panicking in a GUI app might cause the app to freeze (especially a web app) this should be avoided and any errors that cannot be fixed (such as failed logout attempts) should be reported to the user, so they are aware that something went wrong and can safely determine what the next step should be. 

\subsection{Development Tools}

Development tools are important to have to be able to debug and verify a system outside of the server and client.  We developed an Admin CLI tool to allow for us to create test data or find data in the database to verify the functionality of the server and web app.
The CLI does NOT have support for directly testing the server APIs directly, instead other tools such as \href{https://www.postman.com}{Postman} were used to verify the API endpoints against test data.

\subsection{UI Design Patterns}

\section{Known Issues}

\subsection{User Authentication}

\begin{description}
  \item[UI: MISSING] No input validation is performed on the login/register forms.  Empty forms can be submitted.  Has not be found to cause any crashes, just possible security vulnerability.
  \item[AUTH: MISSING] Username matching is case sensitive.
  \item[AUTH: MISSING] No validation for usernames or passwords implemented on server.
  \item[AUTH: MISSING] No validation made to verify when logging in the client doesn't already represent a valid user on server.  However this has no impact right now, it is a potential future security vulnerability.  
\end{description}

\subsection{General UI}

\begin{description}
  \item[UI: BUG] General UI issues such as unaligned text, dropdown menus not closing, etc
  \item[UI: MISSING] No animations for game
\end{description}

\subsection{Leaderboards}

\begin{description}
  \item[UI: MISSING] No way to filter CPU level or board size (filtering CPU level is implemented server-side though)
\end{description}

\subsection{Match Record Database}

\begin{description}
  \item[DATABASE: MISSING] Way to classify board sizes for a match
  \item[DATABASE: MISSING] Handling when a user account is deleted
\end{description}
